# File-Management-Using-Python

This Python-based File Management System was originally developed as a command-line application to help perform basic file operations such as creating, viewing, reading, editing, and deleting files in the current working directory.Code present in app.py

The initial version uses the built-in os module for system-level file handling and standard Python functions like open() for reading and writing files. The CLI interface guides users through a menu-driven system, making it intuitive for beginners to understand file operations using Python.

To enhance usability and provide a more interactive experience, the project was later extended using the Tkinter library â€” Pythonâ€™s standard GUI toolkit. The updated version provides a graphical interface with buttons and dialog boxes for each file operation. Code present in appTkinter.py
